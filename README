TDB_File
========

This module provides bindings to Andrew Tridgell's "Trivial Database"
library (libtdb). TDB is a simple database similar to gdbm, but allows
multiple simultaneous readers and writers.

TDB_File provides a simple tie() interface, similar to DB_File and
friends; and an object-oriented interface, which provides access to
all of the functions in the tdb library.

Currently the hash function (if your TDB version supports it at all)
is set globally, so the last hash function to be set will be used for
all TDB_File objects that specify hash functions.  Other than this
limitation (in the TDB C API), all functionality provided by the TDB C
interface should be available.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL		(see note)
   make
   make test
   make install

NB: Some versions (Debian) of libtdb have changed API, without
changing version numbers or giving any C macros for code to
automatically adapt :( Makefile.PL tries to detect the differences I
know of, please file bugs for any new issues you encounter.  You can
also force particular compatibility options on the Makefile.PL command
line, eg 'perl Makefile.PL hash_func=1' - see the source.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the TDB library, available from:

  http://tdb.sourceforge.net/

TDB_File was developed using libtdb 1.0.6 -- 3 different versions of
1.0.6 in fact..
