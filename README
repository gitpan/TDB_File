TDB_File
========

This module provides bindings to Andrew Tridgell's "Trivial Database"
library (libtdb). TDB is a simple database similar to gdbm, but allows
multiple simultaneous readers and writers.

TDB_File provides a simple tie() interface, similar to DB_File and
friends; and an object-oriented interface, which provides access to
all of the functions in the tdb library.

Currently the logging function is set globally, so the last logging
function to be set will be used for all TDB_File objects.  Other than
this limitation, all functionality provided by the TDB C interface
should be available.

INSTALLATION
